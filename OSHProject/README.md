Building the project:

Android only, so far.

The data in this repo is not sufficient to build the project.  To build, follow the instructions in https://evothings.com/doc/build/cordova-guide.html. 
This will set up the needed android and cordova files.

Those instructions tell you to add plugins, which are needed to utilize bluetooth.  The plugins that are added to the project are: 
cordova-plugin-ble 1.0.0 "Evothings BLE API" and
cordova-plugin-whitelist 1.0.0 "Whitelist"
